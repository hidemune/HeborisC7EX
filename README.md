###Heboris C7EX - unofficial version (YGS2K EX)

This version contains the source code for Heboris C7EX. It requires SDL-1.2,
SDLmixer and SDLimage libraries to play. Additionally, it may be compiled
with openGL support if that is present.

Example dependencies on Ubuntu 15.04 Vivid

    sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev mesa-common-dev

Note, if you don't wish to compile heboris, then the runtime packages only
are required. See the releases section for pre-compiled packages.

#### Todo

This repository would likely be maintained to some degree, but no major changes would be
made to the actual games functionality for the most part. Some simple fixes and changes
may be added, and will be listed in this section if so.

 - Save 40l player data state, or allow a custom setting to be saved and used by default.
 - Fix some problems that occur when changing window focus and reverting back to heboris.
 - Allow traditional tgm style scoring. Heboris inflates the scoring to compensate for
   B2B bonuses.
 - Allow different key configurations for the menu vs. the gameplay.
 - Setup a cmake build system.
 - Any other minor bugs/errors I can find.

If the game screen gets stuck on an image and doesn't change, try deleting your
CONFIG.SAV file from config/data and restarting.

##Heboris Overview

Original changelog and description of heboris is included in the files
changelog.txt and heboris.txt.

----------------------------------------------------
1. 8 Selectable Rules
----------------------------------------------------
You can select 8 different rotation rules.

HEBORIS     : TGM1 and TGM2 style. Same as original heboris rotation.
TI-ARS      : TGM3 style. T and I piece have special ground kick(It works only once!).
TI-WORLD    : SRS, you can move 10 times, or rotate 8 times.
ACE-SRS     : SRS, you can move 128 times, or rotate 128 times
              Fast drop is slower than TI-WORLD.
ACE-ARS     : TGM-ACE style rotation rule. Really strange!
              Fast drop is slower than TI-ARS.
ACE-ARS2    : Same as ACE-ARS, except soft drop and hard drop.
              Fast drop is slower than TI-ARS.
DS-WORLD    : SRS, you can rotate or move infinity!
              Fast drop is slower than TI-WORLD.
SRS-X       : Original rotation rule based on SRS. But you can use Zangi-moves!
               You can move 24 times, or rotate 12 times.
               And C-botton is "180 degree rotarion" with original wall kicks.
D.R.S       : If you have ever played DTET,let's use this!
               Added T and I ground kick(only once!) to it.

----------------------------------------------------
